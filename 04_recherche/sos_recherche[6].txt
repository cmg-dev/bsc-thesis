Abstract: It is possible to decompose a three-dimensional objects into a collection of shadows. The geometric relation permits one to decompose shadows of a three-dimensional object to shadows of planar objects. Using this geometric relations, we prove that a class of non-convex objects is reconstructible from a series of shadows.
